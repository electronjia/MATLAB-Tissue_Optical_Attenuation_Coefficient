# MATLAB-Tissue_Optical_Attenuation_Coefficient

Every signal will have a reduction in its strength the further it travels, therefore, the 
collection of data of scattering and absorption of it will assist on detection of the attenuation of the said medium while affected by the source. When the light source encounters the solution that contains water and milk, it strikes the diode which leads to the production of electron-hole. These electrons go toward the cathode (+) and the hole will be attracted by the anodes (-) as the opposite force attracts each other. (2) These attractions will create a photocurrent which allows the detection fiber to pick up and brighten bulb.
In this experiment, the circuit with the source and detector fiber will be set up to detect the attenuation of the light when it passes through different mediums of water and milk. The circuit allows us to calibrate and learn how mediums influence light detection. Using the oscilloscope, we observed how the system responds, and record the data for further filtering and analysis.

In this experiment we used LED circuit (Figure 1), photodiode circuit (Figure 2), oscilloscope, waveform generator, optical fiber bundles, translation and rotation stages, optical breadboard, and experiment requirements such as beaker with water and/or milk.

The data analysis included fitting the data, establishinh trendline equation, and acquiring peak to peak voltage.

We saw through the results that the light intensity decreased as distance 
between the optical fibers increased in both water and water mixed with milk as seen in figures 4a and 4b. A larger decrease in light intensity was seen in the water mixed with milk supported by its higher attenuation coefficient of -0.3677 compared to that of the water which was -0.4363. Furthermore, despite the optical attenuation function not being a good fit for our data, this conclusion is still supported by the simple exponential regression model used to try to achieve a better fit as seen in figures 5a and 5b where the optical attenuation coefficients for the water and water with milk medium were 0.07 and 0.14 respectively. This shows that distance and 
concentration of a medium influence light intensity. The larger the distance and concentration, the faster and larger the attenuation of light.
